First, place your token on the "App.js" page in line 12 of the "access_token"  and then run the project.

In the search field, you can search for the name of the artist, and in the "Albums list" section, you can receive the list of albums, and by scrolling down, more albums will be loaded.

Clicking on any of the albums will add that album to the "Recently played" section.

In the "Recently Played" section, only our last 6 searches are displayed.
The duplicate album will not be added to the "Recently Played" section, just, the selected album will be moved to the first of the "Recently Played" list

If you get along reply while searching, your token will probably expire and you will need to get a new token and place it on the "App.js" page.

This project is as responsive as possible.
Line awesome is used for fonts.

In the real project, the token should be in the backend, and the called endpoints should point to the services located in the project backend and website, not directly to the Spotify addresses (this project is placed on the App.js page, which is experimental). 

The project is not fully compatible with Spotify due to lack of time as well as testing my abilities, and there are many differences in details.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
